# Focus Crystal over Brass Nuckles
A simple mod that replaces the sprite and descriptions of Starstorm Returns' Brass Knuckles for the Focus Crystal as seen in Risk of Rain 2.

The area-of-effect circle drawn by Starstorm is also now pink and filled in!

If it wasn't obvious, this mod depends on [Starstorm Returns](https://thunderstore.io/c/risk-of-rain-returns/p/RobomandosLab/StarstormReturns/).
